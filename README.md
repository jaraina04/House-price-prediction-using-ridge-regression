# House-price-prediction-using-ridge-regression
In machine learning we write computer programs which automatically improve with experience which are termed as machine learning models. It saves us from explicitly writing code for complex real world data. In this project we are going to use supervised learning, which is a branch of machine learning where we teach our model by examples. Here we will first explore different attributes of Boston housing dataset then a part of dataset will be used to train the linear regression algorithm after that we will use the trained model to give predictions on remaining part of dataset.
